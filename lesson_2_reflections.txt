What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

After you initialize a repository, Git creates a .git folder, which will 
contain much metadata corresponding to all of the commits. However, Git does 
not commit any of the files in the folder, which you can view by entering 'git 
log' into the prompt. Git also does not add any of the files to be tracked 
through commits, which you can view by entering 'git status' into the prompt. 
You need to initialize a repository, because not all folders will store change 
history, only folders initialized as repositories by Git.



How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is a file that contains the information of everything that 
will go into the next commit. This is different from the working directory, 
because it does not necessarily need to include every file from the folder, 
only the ones the user wants to add to the commit. This is also different from 
the repository, because it only contains the information of everything that 
could be committed, but has not necessarily yet.
