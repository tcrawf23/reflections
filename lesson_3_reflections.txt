When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your 
work local?

Keeping all of your work local can be practical when working on a solo project 
from the same computer, but it can become difficult when working on a project 
with a team, or when working on multiple different computers. In these 
scenarios, it would make more sense to use a remote repository.



Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because the remote repository is the combined code of a team, you might not 
always want to automatically pull changes into your local repository, 
especially when you are working on changes yourself. This might conflict with 
your changes, and until you have finished the portion of the code, you might 
not want the new changes to be incorporated yet.
